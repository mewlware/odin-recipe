    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This. This is why you don't have marylander friends.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>4 tbsps pre-cooked yellow corn meal</li>
        <li>1 tsp old bay</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whip the eggs and slowly add the sugar.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the corn meal, old bay and a few tablespoons of the milk in a separate bowl until it’s no longer lumpy. Then heat the mixture while slowly whisking in the rest of the milk and heavy cream until it just starts to bubble.</li>
        <li>Mix a small portion of the hot cream mixture in with the sweet eggs to temper it. </li>
        <li>Place the egg mixture into the full cream mixture in the pot and heat it on low heat while stirring constantly until the whole mixture reaches ~170° F. Immediately take it off the heat and put it in a container to chill in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, put the mixture into an ice cream maker.</li>
        <li>Think of how you’re going to convince your non-Marylander friends to eat this while it’s freezing. You have about an hour.</li>
        <li>Once frozen, put the ice cream into the freezer to set for a few hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>BONUS TIPS!!!</h3>
    <p>Put in more old bay. Do it. I dare you. Put a tablespoon in. Put two tablespoons. Do it.</p>

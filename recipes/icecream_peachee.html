    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You think peanut butter and jelly ice cream is "creative"? How <em>laughable</em>. Peanut butter and <em>Lychee</em> is clearly a winner here.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Ice Cream Base</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup creamy, cheap peanut butter</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Jam</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup peeled & pitted lychees in heavy syrup, drained and blended
            (fresh lychees would probably work, too)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whip the eggs and slowly add the sugar.</li>
        <li>Heat the milk, heavy cream, salt, and peanut butter in a separate pot over low heat until it just starts to bubble.</li>
        <li>Mix a small portion of the hot cream mixture in with the sweet eggs to temper it. </li>
        <li>Place the egg mixture into the full cream mixture in the pot and heat it on low heat while stirring constantly until the whole mixture reaches ~170° F. Immediately take it off the heat and put it in a container to chill in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, put the mixture into an ice cream maker.</li>
        <li>While the ice cream is freezing, mix the blended lychees with the sugar in a pot over low heat until it starts to get jammy. Place in a bowl and let cool.</li>
        <li>When the ice cream is mostly frozen, fold in the cool jam and place the whole thing in the freezer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>BONUS TIPS!!!</h3>
    <p>Honestly, you can just use store bought jam. It’s still really good. The peanut butter is the star here.</p>
